A data analyst is on board a passenger jet
The captain’s voice announced over the radio 
"We have lost an engine, but there’s no need to worry, we can fly on three engines, it will just take us an hour longer to reach our destination."
A while later, the radio crackles again:
“This is your captain speaking, we have lost another engine – but we’re in no danger. Our journey will take an extra two hours though.”
Not long after, the captain is on the radio again: 
“We’re down to one engine, we can make it safely, but we’re going to be landing three hours late.”
“I hope we don’t lose the last engine,” says the analyst, “We’ll be up here forever.”
